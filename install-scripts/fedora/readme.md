# Fedora Auto Install
this isnt a complete auto install due to my dumbass not knowing anything<br>
this will ask for your username twice, one for the installation one for fedora user creation<br>
**Note**: PLEASE USE THE SAME USERNAME<br>
just follow what is in your screen its pretty straight forward 
```
curl -o install-script.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Welpyes/Proot-distro-install-Guide/refs/heads/main/install-scripts/fedora/install-script.sh && bash install-script.sh
```
